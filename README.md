# Module-10-SQL

Create a SQL Database 
It will view and manage the departments, roles, and employee in my company

## Your Task

You will be presented with several options: 
Departments 
Roles, 
Employees. 



The application will be invoked by using the following command:

npm install inquirer
npm install pg 
```

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.
